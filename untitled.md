### __Plot Diagram of Density
![Plot Diagram of pH](./plot1.png)

- A graph displaying density as the grouping
- The highest density recorded is seen to be around 0.997 with a count around 35


### __Scatter Diagram of density against pH__
![Scatter Diagram of Density against Residual sugar](./plot2.png)

- The graph above is a scatter plot of density against pH


### __Bar graph of quality values
![Bar Graph of quality values](.plot3.png)

-The graph above displays the quality values in a bar graph.
-The graph disaplays the first 50 rows of the data set since a large database is being worked on.

### __Scatter Plot of ph against fixed acidity
![Scatter plot of pH against fixed acidity](./plot4.png)

-This plot shows a scatter diagram of pH against fixed acidity of the wine.
-Negative correlation exists in this scatter plot
-The concentration is most defined between 3.0 and 3.6 on pH axis and most defined between 6 and 12 on the fixed acidity axis
